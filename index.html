					How the Web Works
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						The web, once broken down, is a very simple mechanism. The user (you and I) send a request through the computer and its browser to the server through the internet using <em>HTTP</em>. The Server then send the requested information back through the internet to your browser, through he use of HTML documents. The browser then interprets this and displays it on the computers screen.

					HTML
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is the heart of the web. Within a HTML document you have <em>text content</em>, which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which is the "how you see it". HTML also includes references to other documents, such as images and videos <img src="http://adiumxtras.com/images/pictures/reddit_alien_1_3582_2149_image_4512.png" height="30px" width="30px">, as well as links to other pages, like this <a href="http://www.reddit.com">one</a>.

					Tags and Elements
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						HTML documents are made up of <em>elements</em>. The basic structure of a element is the HTML <em>tag</em> its content and the closing tag.

					Why Computer are Stupid
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						This does not mean that computers are stupid in the sense of their incapability to accomplish minor task. It rather refers to the simple fact that a computer does exactly as its being told to. There is no thought process of its own to interpret what the user really wants it to do.

					Inline vs Block Elements
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						A HTML element can either be <em>inline</em>, where the tag is actually within the content, or block, where it creates and ivsible box around its contents.

					Developer Tools
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						Developer tools can be brought up in the browser to allow the user to view that webpages coding. This is helpful in the sense that you can learn from everyone, everywhere. If you see something tat a web page has that you would like to learn, you can simply open the developer tools and read the coding.

					HTML's "Tree-like" Structure
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						This idea stems from the fact that an element can contain multiple elements inside of it. This is similar to a actual tree because it creates a branching effect within the coding itself. Simply, there are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes.

					Identions and Boxes
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						Everything, an I mean everything, in HTML coding is in boxes. You see a circle? It's a box. You see a tringle? It's a box. This is really good because it makes it easy to structure and design a web page easily. With everything in boxes all you have to do is great a gride to neatly align and center your page with structure.

					Text Editors
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						<em>Sublime</em> and <em>scratchpad</em> are just a couple of examples of text editors. These programs help make life easier for programing by doing things such as automatically creating the closing tag.

					Avoiding Repetition
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
          				<p>
          					Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
          				</p>
          				<p>
          					<b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
          				</p>
						<p>
							<b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
						</p>

				<div class="concept-title">
					CSS
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
